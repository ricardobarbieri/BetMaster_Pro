🚀 Introducing BetMaster Pro - Your Ultimate Soccer Betting Analysis Tool! ⚽
Hey GitHub community! 👋  

I'm thrilled to announce BetMaster Pro, an advanced soccer betting analysis tool I’ve been working on to help bettors make data-driven decisions. This project combines real-time data, machine learning, and a modern UI to deliver detailed match predictions and insights. Whether you're a casual bettor or a data enthusiast, BetMaster Pro is here to elevate your game!  
What is BetMaster Pro?

BetMaster Pro is a Python-based application that fetches real-time soccer data from the API-Futebol, processes it with machine learning, and provides actionable betting insights through an interactive graphical interface. It’s designed to help you analyze matches, predict outcomes, and spot betting opportunities with ease.  

✨ Key Features
Real-Time Data: Fetches up-to-date stats from Brazilian championships (like Brasileirão Série A and B).  
Match Predictions: Uses RandomForestClassifier to predict win probabilities, with confidence intervals.  
Betting Insights: Provides implied odds and suggestions for markets like "over/under 2.5 goals" and "both teams to score."  
Interactive Dashboard: See the top 5 teams and teams in the best form at a glance.  
Modern UI: Built with Tkinter and Plotly for a responsive, dark-themed interface with interactive charts.  
Multi-Championship Support: Switch between different leagues with a dropdown menu.

🛠️ How It Works
The app pulls data from API-Futebol and processes metrics like win rate, goal difference, and average goals.  
A machine learning model predicts match outcomes, giving you win probabilities, implied odds, and more.  
Results are displayed in a user-friendly interface with interactive charts and styled statistics.
Here’s a sample prediction for a match between "Vila Nova" and "Goiás":  

Win Probabilities: Vila Nova 62.345% (±4.123%), Goiás 37.655% (±4.123%)  
Implied Odds: Vila Nova 1.60, Goiás 2.66  
Additional Markets: Over 2.5 goals: 45.231%, Both Teams to Score: 32.145%  
Betting Suggestion: Vila Nova
