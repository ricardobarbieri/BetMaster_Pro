#BetMaster Pro - Advanced Sports Betting Analysis System #

BetMaster Pro is an advanced sports betting analysis software focused on soccer, designed to help bettors make informed decisions based on detailed statistics and machine learning predictions. The system collects real-time data from the API-Futebol, processes the information, and presents in-depth analyses and match predictions through a modern and responsive graphical interface.

This project was developed to provide a powerful tool for bettors, offering statistical insights, win probabilities, implied odds, and suggestions for additional betting markets, all wrapped in a visually appealing and interactive design.

#Key Features#
Real-Time Data Collection: Integration with API-Futebol to fetch up-to-date data from Brazilian championships, such as Brasileirão Série A, Série B, and others.

Statistical Analysis: Calculation of metrics like win rate, goal difference, average goals scored and conceded, and a custom score to evaluate team performance.

Match Predictions: Utilizes a machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier) to predict match outcomes, including:
Win probabilities for each team with confidence intervals.

Implied odds for comparison with bookmakers.

Suggestions for additional markets, such as "over/under 2.5 goals" and "both teams to score."

Modern and Responsive Interface: Built with Tkinter, featuring a dark theme, interactive charts (using Plotly), and a responsive layout.

Interactive Dashboard: Visual summary with the top 5 teams by score and teams in the best form, updated dynamically.

Multi-Championship Support: Allows selecting different championships via a dropdown menu, with separate caching for each championship.

Enhanced Styling: Organized and styled statistics with distinct colors for each team, highlighted headers, and interactive charts for a better user experience.

#Technologies Used#
Python 3.8+: Main programming language.

Tkinter: Library for building the graphical interface.

Pandas and NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-Learn: Implementation of the machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier).

Plotly: Generation of interactive charts.

tkinterweb: Integration of Plotly charts into the Tkinter interface.

Requests: HTTP requests to the API-Futebol.

Logging: System for debugging and monitoring logs.
